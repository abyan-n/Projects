Code was written in Python using OpenCV, Mediapipe and Numpy. 

Using different landmarks on the body, calculated angles between wrist, shoulder and elbow to check when user has either achieved or slightly passed 
90 degrees (angle formed with elbow being the mid point) while descending in the push-up position and then checks that the angle reaches slightly above
or at 160 degrees to render a repetition as completed.
